ctf-scoring-engine
==================


There are other CTF scoring engines out there, but I wanted to be able to have a Free for all CTF engine.

Most other engines have questions that you find the flag for. OR you answer a question and that unlocks the next.
They also make you register a user. I didn't want all that hassle. There is no need for it.

I wanted an engine that has no question base, just machines/apps ridden with flags that can all be submitted through one form.
It's pretty simple, just have a database of flags with point values, and another table with a flag and username when one is submitted. Scoreboard sums up all the points.
